Allowing saves & multiple plots on equity chart

- There is no way to load lines but not show them

- After each backtest save the results to a csv saved in "clean_up/backtest_saves" (pandas) done

#dpg.delete_item("equity_series")
#equity_plot(state) FIX THIS because lines duplicate on reload causing errors. Could skip past pre-loaded lines and only calculate new ones.


- Fix exception sets in equity plots
- Second backtest removes the first line and adds another buy and hold line
