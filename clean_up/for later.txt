Allowing saves & multiple plots on equity chart

- There is no way to load lines but not show them

- After each backtest save the results to a csv saved in "clean_up/backtest_saves" (pandas) done

#dpg.delete_item("equity_series")
#equity_plot(state) FIX THIS because lines duplicate on reload causing errors. Could skip past pre-loaded lines and only calculate new ones.




Adding indicators:

state: ema data, and ema period
dataflow holds the set ema fucntion
ema calculations set in charts.py in main chart function and settings window
make new script for calculating new indicators, including: RSI, MACD, ROC
make new settings for it, shouldnt show automatically so only add to settings function
need to add variables to state
make new child windows for all as they are not on-chart indicators
- might have to make a button to switch between volume chart and other indicator charts.
- OR i could change the ratios in the chart resize callback, checks whether the charts are there and then adjusts accordingly. - Incorporate the call back into the save and close button.


- apply strategy to both eth and other crypto currencies?
