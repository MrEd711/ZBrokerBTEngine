Using the yfinance library to integrate FTSE 100 into the program

Subproblems:
- The inputs/formatting that the program takes
- The actual downloading of the data
- Pandas to make a csv of correct formatting
- adding option to the download window
- option to choose ftse 100 for backtesting

1. Downloading data to a csv
- Downloaded whole FTSE
- Reset all indexes
2. Reformatting "DATE" datatype
- currently datetime64[ns, Europe/London]



TODO -> Fix tooltip with if statement to determine whether ETH or FTSE
