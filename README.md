# ZBrokerBTEngine
Back-testing engine for the ZBroker strategy. Inlcudes: data downloader, chart visualiser, backtesting engine, framework for ML integration.



To use download all files. Do not rename any folders or files. 
Run using app.py. 
To use the data downloader navigate to that tab within app.py and then select fetch_eth_csv.py when prompted after clicking download.
Works best on windows machines.
Linux works but messes with the look of the program.
MacOS is yet to be tested.
Bunch of libraries needed to be installed via PIP.
These include (may be more) pandas, numpy, dearpygui, threading, ctypes, requests, typing, argparse, time, pathlib, dataclasses, xgboost, sklearn, sys, subprocess, json.
A lot of these are pre-installed with python, but not all. 
I recommend using a virtual environment.
